<li><p><a href="browsers.htm">Browser Reviews By David George</a> -<br>
Although the pesky LOD bug has long been fixed in most browsers, a few bugs/inconsistancies
still exist in some of the Beta versions of VRML browsers (life on the bleeding
edge). David George has reviewed a majority of the more popular browsers here, and
given us the information we need to pick our favorites from the pack.
<li><a href="b20.htm">VRML 2.0 Browsers</a> -<br>
A couple VRML 2.0 browser betas have already been released. This is where you find out
where to get them. (no reviews yet)
<li><a href="ombuds.htm">Ombudsman Candidates</a> -<br>
To ensure that we continue to move forward, a group of five people have been chosen to
act as "ombudsmen" in the case of a dispute that cannot be resolved through discussion among
the community members.
<li><a href="tutors.htm">Terra Vista VRML Tutors</a> -<br>
In the event that anyone has a question about VRML programming, a couple folks
have volunteered to make themselves available for private tutoring. Included in 
this list are the first VRML 2.0 teachers on the Web!

<h3>The VRML Bookshelf</h3>
There are a couple people who have already reviewed some VRML books, and
I'll leave this job to them.  So far, I've only found two pages that have VRML
book reviews -
<ul><li><a href="http://magazine.cyberiacafe.net/issue-1.1/reviews/reviews6.html">http://magazine.cyberiacafe.net/issue-1.1/reviews/reviews6.html</a>
<li><a href="http://www.connect.hawaii.com/hc/webmasters/books/index.vrml.html">http://www.connect.hawaii.com/hc/webmasters/books/index.vrml.html</a>
</ul>
<p>There is a little overlap in these - both review Mark Pesce's book, and, for
some reason, neither reviewed "The VRML Sourcebook", which is my personal
favorite.
<p>Other note-worthy VRML sources are -
<ul><li>  Special Edition Using VRML, by Stephen Matsuba and Bernie Roehl, Que Publishing -
This book includes a chapter by our own Jeff Sonstein.
<li><a href="http://honors.uhc.asu.edu/~joel/vrml/tutorial/">An Online VRML Tutorial</a>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>The Best VRML Resources On The Web</h3>
<p>Keeping up with VRML is a full-time job, and there are a couple organizations
who have made it their job to keep you up to date.
<ul><li><a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml/">The VRML Repository</a> -<br>
The San Diego Supercomputer Center has long been a driving force on the Web.
This, IMHO, is the ultimate source for any VRML related information, be it
the most recent browsers/tools, or links to some of the best worlds on the
Web.
<li><a href="http://www.inquiry.com/">Inquiry.Com</a> -<br>
Not only VRML, but a sort of repository of articles written about programming
technology and issues.
</ul>
